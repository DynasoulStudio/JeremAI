Open source code found in the [Android JeremAI Offline Image Generator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynasoulstudio.jeremai)

Sampler(s) and Tokenizer code reimplemented in Kotlin/Java are based off of the Huggingface's [diffusersðŸ¤—](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and [transformersðŸ¤—](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) libraries.

Apoligies for the rough code, I was learning Kotlin and how machine learning models work for the first time during this project. Certain things are hard-coded. The code here is not guaranteed to be an accurate re-implementation as my testing methodolgy for accuracy consisted of simply tinkering with things until coherent images started being generated by the model. That said this might be a great way to bootstrap an android version of Stable Diffusion for yourself.

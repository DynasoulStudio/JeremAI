Sampler(s) and Tokenizer code reimplmented in Kotlin/Java are based off of the Huggingface diffusers and transformers libraries:

Apoligies for the rough code, I was learning Kotlin and how machine learning models work for the first time during this project. Certain things are hard-coded. The code here is not guaranteed to be an accurate re-implementation as my testing methodolgy for accuracy consisted of simply tinkering with things until coherent images started being generated by the model. That said this might be a great way to bootstrap an android version of Stable Diffusion for yourself.
